v1.0
The destor consists of ram-based index, DDFS-based index, LRU cache, 
cfl-monitor, typical dedup, selective dedup, and pipeline.
And it can offer backup/recovery services.  v1.1
The destor has implemented nearly optimal replacement cache,
which can accelerate the recovering of jobs that are suffered from internal
fragmentation.
The config file of server and its corresponding functions has been changed.

v1.2
A new monitor called container_usage_monitor is implemented.
It can collect more details on container fragmentation
than cfl_monitor.

v2.0
destor_client has been removed, so destor is no longer C/S architecture.

v2.1
Context-based rewritting algorithm has been implemented.

v2.2
New feature, Extreme Binning without file-level dedup, is added.

v2.3
New feature, SiLo is added.

v2.4
Make it more easy to use.

v2.5
New feature, history-based rewriting algorithm (HBR) and CBR-assisted HBR.

v2.6
New features, capping rewriting algorithm and forward assembly area technology, have been added.

v2.7
capping-assisted HBR has been added.

v3.0
Large upgrades in destor.
Add new feature CFL-assisted HBR.

v3.1
Add new feature cache filter, which can used to improve CFL, CBR and CAP.

v3.2
Optimize the capping algorithm, and the new algorithm is named Enhanced-CAP
(ECAP).

v3.3
New Feature!
Sparse Index is added.

v4.0
Rename prepare_phase to segment_phase.
Redefine the protocol between segment_phase and index module.

v4.1
Normalized rabin chunking is added.

v4.2
The bug caused by deep directory tree is fixed.
Simulation level is added.
